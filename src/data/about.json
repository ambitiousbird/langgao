    "introduction":"September, 2014, after I got a bachelor degree in Chemical Engineering, I joined the Chemistry PhD program at Temple University, seeking opportunities in chemistry research that have the potential to make significant impact in real life. However, as the power and beauty of technologies brought to life by computer science rapidly unfold, I found that my battleground lies in computer and information science, where there are numerous opportunities for innovations and latest technologies can be quickly applied to make the world a better place. I therefore switched my path and got a master's degree in Computer Science. <br><br> With a strong passion for entrepreneurship, I'm enthusiastic about opportunities in social engineering innovations, that's why I worked on <a href=\"https://mutualityapp.com/\">Mutuality</a>, a social network platform that strives to help people to make effective, healthy, and inspiring social connections with others and together build a happier and more harmonious society. While investing part-time on Mutuality, I worked at Temple University as a software engineer where my day to day job was data mining, web development and linux server maintenance, until I found a front end engineer position at SES Networks, a world-leading satellite operator in Virginia. I helped develop an enhanced file management system as well as device drivers. I'm currently working at Capital One as a UI developer to help migrating a large web application from AngularJS to latest Angular. The work consists of converting individual features that live in an Nx-powered monorepo from AngularJS to Angular, and adding tests that allow the features to be deployed automatically to production via an existing Continuous Delivery pipeline."
